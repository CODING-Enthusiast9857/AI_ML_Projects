## Overview

This repository contains a machine learning project for predicting house prices based on various features. Predicting house prices can be a crucial task for both buyers and sellers, as well as real estate agents. In this project, we have developed a machine learning model that takes into account various factors to provide accurate house price predictions.

## Key Features

- Data preprocessing and cleaning: We have cleaned and preprocessed the dataset to handle missing values, outliers, and feature engineering.
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): We have performed EDA to gain insights into the dataset and understand the relationships between features and the target variable.
- Model selection: We have experimented with multiple machine learning algorithms, including linear regression, lasso, ridge, to find the best model for this task.
- Model evaluation: We have used appropriate evaluation metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and R-squared to assess the model's performance.
- Hyperparameter tuning: We have optimized the model's hyperparameters to achieve the best possible performance.
- Deployment: We have deployed the trained model using Flask, creating a simple web application for house price predictions.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project is available in this directory. It contains various features related to houses, such as the number of bedrooms, square footage, location, and more.
