This repository contains a machine learning project that analyzes the famous Iris dataset. The Iris dataset is a popular dataset in the field of machine learning and is often used for classification tasks.

## Project Overview

The primary goal of this project is to demonstrate the application of machine learning techniques for data analysis, including data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation. In this project, we explore the Iris dataset, create and train machine learning models, and assess their performance.

## Dataset

The Iris dataset consists of 150 samples of iris flowers, each with four features (sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width). The samples are categorized into three different species of iris: Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica. The dataset is commonly used to test classification algorithms.

To download Iris dataset included in this repository as https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/iris

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:
